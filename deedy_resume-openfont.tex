%Google spec: Experience in the product design process, including requirements gathering, concepts generation and detailed design, analysis and verification testing, cross functional reviews and manufacturing release.
%Experience in multiple areas of product design such as thermal, structural, manufacturability, serviceability and reliability.
%--Worked with diverse team of designers, engineers and business people to create a product that would enable the general population to connect with those they care about without a screen.
--Designed product with diverse team and generated requirements using a specific case of concussion patients before generalizing to a larger user base. A cross-functional design process lead to this generalization and other decisions.\\
--Ideated and refined concepts to develop a final product concept. \\
--Designed and developed working, deployable software to verify concept. Reviewed mechanical design of working model and final, production design.
